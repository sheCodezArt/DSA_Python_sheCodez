# DSA Using Python3

Here are 20 basic mathematical Python exercises for you to practice. I've included a mix of simple calculations, conditional statements, loops, and basic functions.

## Mathematical Python Exercises

1. *Addition*: Write a Python program to add two numbers, 5 and 7.
2. *Area of Rectangle*: Calculate the area of a rectangle with length 10 and width 5.
3. *Circle Area*: Compute the area of a circle with radius 4 ($\pi r^2$).
4. *Simple Interest*: Calculate simple interest with principal=1000, rate=5%, time=2 years.
5. *Even/Odd Check*: Write a program to check if 11 is even or odd.
6. *Sum of First N Naturals*: Find the sum of the first 10 natural numbers (1+2+...+10).
7. *Average of 3 Numbers*: Compute the average of 4, 7, and 10.
8. *Temperature Conversion*: Convert 30Â°C to Fahrenheit ($F = C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32$).
9. *Greatest of Two*: Write a program to find the greater of 8 and 12.
10. *Multiplication Table*: Print the multiplication table of 5 (up to 5x10).
11. *Factorial*: Calculate the factorial of 5 ($5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$).
12. *Power*: Compute $2^8$ using Python.
13. *Modulus*: Find the remainder when 17 is divided by 3.
14. *Sum of Squares*: Calculate $1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2$.
15. *Check Divisibility*: Check if 15 is divisible by 3.
16. *Quadratic Equation*: Solve $x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0$ for $x$.
17. *Absolute Difference*: Find $|10 - 20|$.
18. *Min of 3 Numbers*: Find the minimum of 3, 10, and 5.
19. *Sum using Loop*: Use a loop to sum numbers from 1 to 5.
20. *Distance*: Calculate the distance between points (1,2) and (4,6) ($\sqrt{(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2}$).

Tips
- Use Python's `math` module for operations like `sqrt`, `pi`.
- Practice using loops, conditionals, and basic functions.
