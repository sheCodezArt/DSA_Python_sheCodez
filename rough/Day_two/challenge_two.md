# Arithmetic Operations in Python

This project demonstrates the basic arithmetic operations in Python:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

**Getting Started**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
3. Create a script file using Python.

**Usage**

The script takes two numbers as input and performs the following operations:

- Addition: `a + b`
- Subtraction: `a - b`
- Multiplication: `a * b`
- Division: `a / b`

**Example Input/Output**

Input:
```
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
```
Output:
```
Addition: 5 + 3 = 8
Subtraction: 5 - 3 = 2
Multiplication: 5 * 3 = 15
Division: 5 / 3 = 1.67
```
**Code Explanation**

The script uses basic Python syntax to perform the arithmetic operations:

- `input()` function to get user input
- `print()` function to display the results
- Basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to perform the operations
